      "question": "what is a cord",
      "answer": "A \"cord\" seems to be a typographical error, and it is likely that you meant \"chord.\" In music, a chord is a combination of three or more pitches that are played or sung simultaneously. Chords are fundamental to harmony and can be built on various scales and keys. \n\nIf you are looking for specific information about chords, such as their types or functions, you might find relevant details in the context of modulation and tonicization, which are discussed on pages 169-171. For example, modulation involves changing from one key to another, which often involves the use of chords that facilitate this transition. Tonicization refers to the use of applied chords or secondary functions that temporarily emphasize a different tonic within a piece of music. \n\nIf you need more detailed information about chords or their applications, please let me know!"
