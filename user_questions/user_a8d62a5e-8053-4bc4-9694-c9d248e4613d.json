      "answer": "To play \"Let's Get Silly!\", follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: While listening to the piece, point to the notes and sing the lyrics. Tap and count the rhythm to familiarize yourself with the piece (Page 19).\n\n2. **Counting Rests**: Remember that a Half Rest fills the time of two quarter rests, which is equal to 2 beats. Count it as “1 2” for the rests (Page 19).\n\n3. **Performance**:\n   - Play lines one and three an octave higher (8va), while the teacher plays lines two and four, or vice versa (Page 19).\n   - When playing the entire piece, use a light and bouncy touch, ensuring to observe all quarter rests and half rests (Page 19).\n\n4. **Practice**: Block out the piece by playing only specific sections to master the rhythm and notes before playing the entire piece (Page 19).\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to perform \"Let's Get Silly!\" effectively!"
