2025-05-19 21:49:16,028 - knowledge_processor - INFO - Answer: When starting to play, you should position your hands in the middle of the keyboard. If you are using your left hand, you should play the groups of three black keys with fingers 2-3-4 going down the keyboard (Page 12). If you are using your right hand, you should play the groups of three black keys with fingers 2-3-4 going up the keyboard (Page 12). 

When playing the C D E groups, you should use fingers 3-2-1 with your left hand (Page 23). If you are using your right hand, start at the low end of the keyboard and play the C D E groups with individual fingers 1-2-3 going up the keyboard (Page 23). 

Remember to keep a natural curve of your hand and gently lift your wrist between repetitions (Page 23).

2025-05-20 11:22:45,255 - knowledge_processor - INFO - Answer: When starting to play the keyboard, it's important to position your hands correctly to facilitate ease of movement and proper technique. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Hand Position**: Your fingers should be curved and relaxed, with your fingertips resting on the keys. This allows for better control and agility when playing (Page 74).

2. **Thumb Placement**: Your thumbs should be placed on the white keys, typically on the C note if you are starting in the middle of the keyboard. This is often referred to as the "home position" for beginners (Page 73).

3. **Wrist Height**: Keep your wrists level with the keyboard, not too high or too low. This helps prevent strain and allows for fluid movement across the keys (Page 74).

4. **Fingering**: Familiarize yourself with the layout of the keyboard and the placement of notes. This visual reference will help you navigate the keys more effectively (Page 73).

By following these guidelines, you can establish a solid foundation for playing the keyboard.
